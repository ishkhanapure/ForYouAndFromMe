       Ishwar being good at multiple things but best at nothing. Tried making this introduction website because this is the only design thing where you cant match me and actually will seem interesting, I had zero idea and knowledge about making this site till yesterday and actually made it in a day. I know this is nothing in comparison of energy you put. All this is just to try doing something creative and escape from my confusing reality. I always used to know what i am supposed to do and now all i am doing is just thinking and executing nothing.
