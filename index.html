        Surbhi, You are a always beautiful artist for me, your actions has always carried a calmness that has spoken louder to me. I've always admired you for your creativity and i will keep thinking of you that ways, thats the the real cool of you for me. Maybe both of us have changed now, but you have taught me so much for life. Maybe this looks childish but i dont care unless its you. Your spirit, your kindness deserved nothing but respect and care where i had to fail for myself ,I keep thinking that i owe something to you. Made this from scratch today.

        However, Ishwar being good at multiple things but best at nothing always feel that i have left behind a part of myself incomplete whenever i try to go for new things. I don't know whatever you think of me now, but i will make sure that i'll never let you down. We both have long way to go and i wish you do great at your art ahead. I had zero idea and knowledge about making this site till yesterday but i realised this is the only design thing where you cant match me. I know this is nothing in comparison of energy you've drained but i no more can keep thinking of this as i have to go a long way. All this for a new start of totally different phase of life for me.
